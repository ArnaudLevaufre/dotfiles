# My dotfiles

# Installation using stow

[Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) can be used to install the dotfiles
as symlinks from the tree directory to the user home directory like so:

```
stow -v tree -t ~
```

# Recommendation

I do not recommend using my dotfiles directly as they will not suit your needs.
Instead, you can take a look at the repository and find useful configuration
option yo may like.
